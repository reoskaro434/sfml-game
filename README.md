You can download the game as a .zip file by following this link: [SFML Game Download.](https://github.com/reoskaro434/sfml-game/blob/master/RiD_RPGproject/game%20exe%20dir.zip)

This is an unfinished game featuring a graphical user interface (GUI), non-playable characters (NPCs), and sound, all powered by SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

In this game, you'll encounter bots that utilize the A* (A star) algorithm to find paths between two points. This same algorithm is also used to navigate the player's character.

Feel free to explore this SFML-powered gaming experience!
